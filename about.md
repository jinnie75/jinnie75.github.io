title: A little about me...

---

Hi there! 👋🏼
My name is Jinhee and it’s pronounced more like [Jinnie], without much accent on the ‘h’ 😊

I am a product manager based in Seoul, South Korea. Most of my career has been in e-commerce, which was one of the fastest growing industries in the recent years. 

I am an avid collector of stories, eager to take in others’ and to tell my own. Topics I enjoy exploring include the environment, mental health, and diversity & inclusion.

In my free time I am constantly busy learning new things - ballet has been my passion for the last few years and before that, learning new languages.

I don’t dream of being the superhero, but the super smart sidekick who’s good at everything, that the heroine is powerless without. It is my dream to be the wings to those with bigger ideas than mine, to help their dreams come true. 💫
